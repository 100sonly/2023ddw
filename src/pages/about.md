# About Data Driven World (DDW)

This course provides fundamentals for students with the necessary skills in a data driven world. The first half of the course focuses on providing students with algorithmic thinking and different paradigms of computation such as procedural, object-oriented design and state machine. The second half of the course focuses on a basic introduction to machine learning for categorical and continuous data. Students will be able to apply both algorithms and basic machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems driven by data and computation.

# Prerequisite

10.014 Computational Thinking for Design (Term 1)
